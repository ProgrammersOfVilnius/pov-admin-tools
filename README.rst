PoV admin tools
===============

A set of scripts we use at PoV for managing servers:

- new-changelog-entry: keeps a sysadmin diary (/root/Changelog)

- machine-summary: prints a short description of this machine (as
  ReStructuredText)

- disk-inventory: prints an overview of your disks and partitions
